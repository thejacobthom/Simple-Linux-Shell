        commands are executed
 - No bugs found, possibility of some memory leaks but they are believed to be covered
 - flair occasionally added with print statements, these can be ignored but just made the program look a little
        nicer (especially for unkown users who might want feedback)
 - developed with the aid of stackoverflow and other online resources
